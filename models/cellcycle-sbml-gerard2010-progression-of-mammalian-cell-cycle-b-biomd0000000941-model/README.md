# Gerard2010 - Progression of mammalian cell cycle by successive activation of various cyclin cdk complexes

**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Claude Gérard; Albert Goldbeter

## Description

We previously proposed a detailed, 39-variable model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls progression along the successive phases of the mammalian cell cycle. Here, we prop


## Usage
