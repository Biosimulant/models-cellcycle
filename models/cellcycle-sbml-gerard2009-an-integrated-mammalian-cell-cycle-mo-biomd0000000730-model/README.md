# Gerard2009 - An Integrated Mammalian Cell Cycle Model

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000730)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Claude Gérard; Albert Goldbeter

## Description

We propose an integrated computational model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls the dynamics of the mammalian cell cycle. The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by
