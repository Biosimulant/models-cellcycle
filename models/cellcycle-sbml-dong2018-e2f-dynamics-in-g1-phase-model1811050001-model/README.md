# Dong2018 - E2F dynamics in G1 phase

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1811050001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Peng Dong; Carolyn Zhang; Bao-Tran Parker; Lingchong You; Bernard Mathey-Prevot

## Description

The length of the G1 phase in the cell cycle shows significant variability in different cell types and tissue types. To gain insights into the control of G1 length, we generated an E2F activity report


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/cellcycle-sbml-dong2018-e2f-dynamics-in-g1-phase-model1811050001-model/model.yaml
